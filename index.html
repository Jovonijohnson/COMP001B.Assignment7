            What worked well over the last eight weeks and aided your learning process? <!-- A second-level heading posing a question -->
        </h2>

        <p>
            Flexbox and grid layout models make it simpler to create complex, responsive layouts without using floats or other outdated techniques. They provide clear and powerful ways to align and distribute space among elements. <!-- A paragraph explaining what worked well -->
        </p>
        <h2>
            What would you change about the course? <!-- A second-level heading posing another question -->
        </h2>
        <p>
            I would change the lectures from being worth no points to 25% of the grade. <!-- A paragraph suggesting a change to the course -->
        </p>
        <h2>
            Did you learn what you expected to learn in this course? <!-- A second-level heading asking about expectations -->
        </h2>
        <p>
            I didn't learn what I expect to learn because I thought the assignments would be more user creation. Not trying to imitate the teacher's code. <!-- A paragraph about learning expectations -->
        </p>
        <h2>
            What concepts were new to you, and what concepts have you already encountered in the past? <!-- A second-level heading asking about new and familiar concepts -->
        </h2>

        <p>
            The concept of the box model and variable functions is new to me. The concept of adding color to a web page is something I have encountered before. <!-- A paragraph discussing new and familiar concepts -->
